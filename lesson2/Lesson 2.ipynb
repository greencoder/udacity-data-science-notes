    "In this exercise, we will perform some rudimentary practices similar to those of an actual data scientist.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Part of a data scientist's job is to use her or his intuition and insight to write algorithms and heuristics. A data scientist also creates mathematical models to make predictions based on some attributes from the data that they are examining.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like for you to take your knowledge and intuition about the Titanic and its passengers' attributes to predict whether or not the passengers survived or perished. You can read more about the Titanic and specifics about this dataset at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic\n",
    "- http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted\n",
    "        \n",
    "In this exercise and the following ones, you are given a list of Titantic passengers and their associated information. More information about the data can be seen at the  link below:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you need to write a simple heuristic that will use the passengers' gender to predict if that person survived the Titanic disaster.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**You prediction should be 78% accurate or higher.**\n",
    "        \n",
    "Here's a simple heuristic to start off:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the passenger is female, your heuristic should assume that the passenger survived.\n",
    "1. If the passenger is male, you heuristic should assume that the passenger did not survive.\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can access the gender of a passenger via `passenger['Sex']`. If the passenger is male, `passenger['Sex']` will return a string `male`. If the passenger is female, `passenger['Sex']` will return a string `female`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your prediction back into the `predictions` dictionary. The key of the dictionary should be the passenger's id (which can be accessed via `passenger[\"PassengerId\"]`) and the associated value should be `1` if the passenger survied or `0` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a passenger is predicted to have survived:\n",
    "```\n",
    "passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']\n",
    "predictions[passenger_id] = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And if a passenger is predicted to have perished in the disaster:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']\n",
    "predictions[passenger_id] = 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
